Common Code Library: Modification history

v1.0.0  - Initial version, based on RAT v3.2.7
	* 14 November 1998

v1.0.1  - Added HMAC authentication code
	- Added timeout to udp_recv()
	- Added authentication of Mbus messages
	- Added RTP library
	- Added select and fd_set functions to net_udp.[ch]
	- IPv6 code now runs on the pre-release stack for Solaris 2.7
	- Mbus code support a configuration file on Unix, and the registry
	  on Win32, to save/restore settings
	- Add udp_host_addr() to get a text-version of the address to which
	  a socket is bound.
	- Set IPv6 ttl and loopback state correctly on Solaris
	- Move mbus hearbeat code into this library
	- Remove key expiry from the mbus code, since it created race
	  conditions when multiple tools for a single conference were
	  started either side of the expiry time.
	- Update mbus addressing scheme - names are now sets of tokens, if the
	  set of tokens in the destination address is a subset of the address 
	  of the entity receiving that message then the message is accepted. An
	  empty set is a valid destination address for a message, and that will
	  be accepted by all receivers (ie: a wildcard).
	- Remove channel ID from mbus code.
	- Fix configure script to work with solaris 2.7 where inet_aton() and 
	  inet_pton() have prototypes but no implementation.
	* 31 March 1999 [rat v4.0.0]

v1.0.2  - Assorted fixes to RTP library
	- Fix bounds overruns in memory.c - will now run with -DDEBUG_MEM
	  with the bounds checker on.
	- Add timestamp to mbus packet headers.
	- Add mbus_qmsgf()
	- Cleanup mbus transmission path
	- Add support for DES encryption to the mbus (on by default)
	- Fix DES code
	- Mbus keeps a cache of other entities, and only allows sending of
	  reliable messages to known unicast addresses. 
	- Mbus error function now takes a "type of error" argument
	- Added xrealloc()
	- Fix reordering of mbus messages
	* 14 May 1999 [rat v4.0.1]

v1.0.3  - Fix inet_aton() in net_udp.c
	* 15 May 1999 [rat v4.0.2]

v1.0.4  - Fix compilation with Microsoft IPv6 stack
	- Solaris 2.5.1 doesn't have vsnprintf(), use vsprintf() instead
	  and don't worry about the possible buffer overflow problems. 
	  Reported by Holger Wirtz.
	- Added mbus_addr_valid()
	- Added timeout to mbus_recv()
	- Fixes to mbus code from Dirk Kutscher
	* 2 June 1999 [rat v4.0.3]

v1.0.5	- Not quite sure what happened with this version, but if you have
          it it's probably not a good idea to use it! :-)

v1.0.6	- Add ability to send to one port whilst receiving on another, 
	  requested by Henning Schulzrinne.
	- Add mbus_cmd_handler() to change the function handling the
	  reception of mbus commands.
	- Compilation fixes for Irix 6.5 contributed by Bob Olson.
	- Add extra sanity checking to mbus_recv()
	- Add extra sanity checking to mbus_parse_*
	- Fix source address passed to mbus_recv() callback - was missing
	  the "(" and ")" around it.
	- Fix memory leak in mbus_recv()
	- Fixes for configure script on 64 bit IRIX from Peter Orbaek
	- Move base64 tests into test_base64.c and integrate with the test suite
	* Released 5 July 1999 

v1.0.7  - Add udp_exit to close sockets and leave multicast groups if necessary.
	- Fix mbus_exit close sockets.
	- Move the code to deal with the mbus configuration into mbus_config.c
	  which will make it easier to write an mbus packet logger without code 
	  duplication (such a logger can't easily be part of mbus.c, since it's
	  needs conflict with correct protocol operation).
	- Note that v1.3 of the Microsoft Research IPv6 stack requires an explicit
	  route to be added for multicast traffic before a group can be joined. If
	  you get errors in the IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP setsockopt, this is probably
	  the reason. We could specify an interface explicitly, but which one to
	  pick?
	- Updates to the IPv6 code for the Detexis Musica IPv6 stack
	- Updates to the RTP code from Markus Germeier: time-out and delete sources,
	  fix X but in RTP header, add support for sending BYE packets.
	- Add inet_pton() and inet_ntop() implementations, for those platforms
	  which are missing them.
	- Add gettimeofday() workaround for win32
	- Add drand48() workaround for win32
	* Released 20 August 1999

v1.0.8	- Add mbus_sent_all()
	- Add loop count to mbus_recv(), so it will always return after 10
	  packets have been received. The prevents a denial of service attack
	  if packets are sent faster than the timeout period.
	- Add binary tree.
	- Add OpenBSD fixes from Angelos D. Keromytis
	- Add Jerry Isdale's debug_dump() routine.

Still to do...
	- IPv6 code sometimes doesn't get the correct interface address,
	  since it does a gethostbyname() and looks that up, yet that can
	  return the IPv4 hostname only on some machines.
	- Doesn't do DNS AAAA lookups when given a name rather than an IP address.
	- "instance:pid" in mbus addresses?
	- We use hmac_md5 and the mbus spec requires hmac_md5_96? Bug in
	  the spec, since they both reference RFC2104?
	- Fixed offsets in the mbus config file parser?
	- Mbus code should check timestamp in received headers, and discard
	  messages if it decreases, as a hinderance to replay attacks.
	- Mbus code should be more paranoid about handling garbage inputs, we
	  can likely get all sorts of buffer overflows by feeding random data
	  into it.
	- rtp_recv should split into rtp_select and rtp_recv. Jitter issues
	  otherwise, as pointed out by Orion.
