Common Code Library: Modification history

v1.0.0  - Initial version, based on RAT v3.2.7
	* 14 November 1998

v1.0.1	- Added HMAC authentication code
	- Added timeout to udp_recv()
	- Added authentication of Mbus messages
	- Added RTP library
	- Added select and fd_set functions to net_udp.[ch]
	- IPv6 code now runs on the pre-release stack for Solaris 2.7
	- Mbus code support a configuration file on Unix, and the registry
	  on Win32, to save/restore settings
	- Add udp_host_addr() to get a text-version of the address to which
	  a socket is bound.
	- Set IPv6 ttl and loopback state correctly on Solaris
	- Move mbus hearbeat code into this library
	- Remove key expiry from the mbus code, since it created race
	  conditions when multiple tools for a single conference were
	  started either side of the expiry time.
	- Update mbus addressing scheme - names are now sets of tokens, if the
	  set of tokens in the destination address is a subset of the address 
	  of the entity receiving that message then the message is accepted. An
	  empty set is a valid destination address for a message, and that will
	  be accepted by all receivers (ie: a wildcard).
	- Remove channel ID from mbus code.
	- Fix configure script to work with solaris 2.7 where inet_aton() and 
	  inet_pton() have prototypes but no implementation.


Still to do...
	- Mbus code doesn't support encryption
	- IPv6 code sometimes doesn't get the correct interface address,
	  since it does a gethostbyname() and looks that up, yet that can
	  return the IPv4 hostname only on some machines.
	- Doesn't do DNS AAAA lookups when given a name rather than an IP address.
